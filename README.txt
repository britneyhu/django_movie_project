DJANGO MOVIE PROJECT

Features:
A website that displays a database of movies the user has watched. The user can add movies along with their rating of it through a form and it will be added to the database. The user can sort through their movies by genre, director, rating, and the date it was released through the menu or search function. They can also edit movie information and delete movies.

Information:
The website was built using the Django web framework. It uses Python for backend, HTML, CSS, and Javascript for frontend, and Postgresql as the database.
